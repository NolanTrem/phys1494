# Physics 1494: Intro to Experimental Physics
Columbia University, Fall 2023

## Overview

This repository contains lab reports, data, and analysis scripts for the Physics 1494 course at Columbia University. The course focuses on introducing the fundamental principles of experimental physics, data analysis techniques, and scientific writing. Laboratory work is associated with the two prerequisite lecture courses. Experiments in mechanics, thermodynamics, electricity, magnetism, optics, wave motion, atomic physics, and nuclear physics. 

## Lab Experiments

1. **Experiment 1**: Velocity, Acceleration, and \( g \)
   - **Description**: This experiment explores the concepts of velocity and acceleration, with a focus on the gravitational acceleration \( g \).
   - **Files**:
